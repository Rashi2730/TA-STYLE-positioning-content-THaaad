Fashion appears in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, hairstyles, lifestyle, and body proportions.The definition of Fashion does not remain restricted to clothing choices only. A person’s Fashion is defined by how one carries oneself – this includes within its realm clothing sense, etiquette, and personality and how one conducts oneself. However, to narrow it down, the clothing inclination, in general, takes up a significant portion of what Fashion broadly is."</p>
